All models were created from the original in Solidworks. The files exported to STL are based in "mm."

Printing for prototypes was originally done on a Prusa i3 clone, but then changed to my department's Lulzbot Taz6 printers.
Of materials, PLA gave the best results, followed by HIPS, and then ABS and nGen (neither good for high speed).  
Required >50% infill to sustain high speeds when under load.
