# Hard-Drive-Centrifuge
DIY Arduino-powered centrifuge from an old hard drive spindle and 3D printed rotor

Inspired by the work from Kemal Ficici (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/kemfic/developing-a-low-cost-microcentrifuge-using-e-waste-04b525), my lab was in need of a quick-portable centrifuge and modified the desin for an AIO system, with secure mounting holes, an enclosure, and emergency shutdown options.  The modified code also allows for speeds in RPM or G's, based on the 3D printed rotor dimensions.

The next step would be to have options for spin settings to be timed or pulsed, similar to our standard lab centrifuges.
